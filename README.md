# Things Missing in High School Computer Science

## Introduction ##

Being a high schooler myself on the computer science path, I often find myself searching for different topics in the field that lie past the scope of generic high school courses (AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science Applications, and any other basic courses your high school offers). However, I firmly believe that these high school courses are much needed to grasp the intricacies of complex computer science topics. Consequently, I have decided to create a comprehensive guide that thoroughly explores topics that I believe every high school student looking to leave college with a CS degree should know of. Throughout this guide, I will be providing links to research papers, courses, blogs, and other websites that will provide you with extra information on the topics covered.

Before we start, let’s go over the basics. According to an [article](https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science) by Britannica, computer science is defined as “the study of computers and computing as well as their theoretical and practical applications. Computer science applies the principles of mathematics, engineering, and logic to a plethora of functions, including algorithm formulation, software, and hardware development, and artificial intelligence.” Average high school computer science courses thoroughly explore computer functionality (parts of a computer etc.), offer a light exposure to ordinary coding languages (Python, Java), and hardly encourage application-level software development. This guide dives into the worlds of artificial intelligence and machine learning, cybersecurity, web development, web design, software development, and app development. 

Throughout this guide, you will come across courses and projects that require coding. Knowing Python and Java are a must! If needed, you can check out a full Python tutorial on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). You can also check out a full Java tutorial on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgl81fPcLc8&ab_channel=Amigoscode). In addition, here are a few IDEs that, in my opinion, are among the best: [PyCharm Community Version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) (Python), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Java), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (HTML, Javascript, other), [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Mac users), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

So, let’s dive right in.
